Formalized Bioinformatics and Reliable Software (ForBaRS)

The project's goals are inventing a new type of mathematics tailored for the needs of Bioinformatics
(if possible), formalizing approaches applied in Bioinformatics and developing reliable software
(certified with proves and highly tested) for researchers and everyone interested.


A current schedule of updates and commits after refactoring and commenting the code
is:

4 Feb. - first Coq specifications of local alignment (Smith-Waterman) for DNA case (Done)

10 Feb. - Ada code implementing Smith-Waterman alignment (non-optimized)

17 Feb. - improved Coq specifications of local alignment

24 Feb. - a simple verified program performing Smith-Waterman alignment in Coq

1 March - Local alignment specifications and code examples implemented with SPARK and Ada

To be announced ....
