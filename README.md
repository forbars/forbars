Formalized Bioinformatics and Reliable Software (ForBaRS)

The project's goals are inventing a new type of mathematics tailored for the needs of Bioinformatics
(if possible), formalizing approaches applied in Bioinformatics and developing reliable software
(certified with proves and highly tested) for researchers and everyone interested.


A current schedule of updates and commits after refactoring and commenting the code
is:

4 Feb. Tuesday - first Coq specifications of local alignment (Smith-Waterman) for DNA case

10 Feb. Monday - improved Coq specifications of local alignment with polymorphism and general type of sequences
                 Ada code implementing Smith-Waterman alignment (non-optimized)

17 Feb. Monday - a simple verified program performing Smith-Waterman alignment in Coq

24 Feb. Monday - Local alignment specifications and code examples implemented with SPARK
and Ada

To be announced ....
