{"name":"ForBaRS","tagline":"Formal Bioinformatics and Reliable Software","body":"The project's goals are: \r\n\r\n* invent a new type of mathematics tailored for the needs of Bioinformatics\r\n(if it is possible). We take an exploratory approach, without assuming that some of the existing \r\nmathematical theories are the correct choice.\r\n \r\n* formalize approaches applied in Bioinformatics and developing reliable software\r\n(certified with proves and highly tested) for researchers and everyone interested.\r\n\r\nThe current schedule of updates and commits after re-factoring and commenting the code is:\r\n\r\n_4 Feb. Tuesday - first Coq specifications of local alignment (Smith-Waterman) for DNA case **(Done)**_\r\n\r\n_10 Feb.
